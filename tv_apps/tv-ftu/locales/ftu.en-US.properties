# Activation
welcome-to-fx-os=Welcome to Firefox OS, the free and open source operating system from Mozilla. Our mission is to promote openness, innovation and opportunity by keeping the power of the Web in your hands.
initial-activation=Initial Activation: Upon initial activation of your Firefox OS device, Firefox OS sends to Mozilla a one-time data ping (e.g., data relating to device specific information such as software release version, partner ID, country and screen size) which helps Mozilla determine if security updates and critical fixes are needed for our users and partners, determine requirements for app developers so they can build better apps for our users, and helps Mozilla with market analysis (e.g., determine how many devices have been activated).
updates=Updates: To keep itself up to date, Firefox OS automatically connects to a service operated by or on behalf of the manufacturer of your device. Firefox OS also automatically checks for updates to installed apps by sending a request to the web apps discovery portal or, if you installed an app from another location, that app’s developer’s services.

# App usage
app-usage-content=App Usage: In order to improve content discovery on web apps discovery portal, Firefox OS sends "Application Usage Information" (e.g., active use time, counts of opens/closes/crashes, list of uninstalled apps on Firefox OS devices) to Mozilla. You can disable the sharing of App Usage Information in the Settings on your device.
device-is-created-by-several-parties=The device you are using is created by several parties. This notice only covers how Mozilla handles your information for official versions of Firefox OS authorized by Mozilla.
